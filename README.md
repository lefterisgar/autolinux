## Goal
If you have ever installed a mainstream Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu or Fedora), you may have found it too "bloated" for your taste. There are many useless utilities and daemons which are only essential for servers and/or power users. They consume disk space, run in the background and slow down your PC at boot. The most popular and beginner friendly distribution out there, Ubuntu, is no exception to that. By endorsing snap packages, telemetry and other useless features (e.g. Ubuntu Advantage), Ubuntu has gotten a very bad reputation for being a memory hog. Despite that fact, it still is in my opinion the most stable and mature distribution, while being easy to use is another important thing. AutoLinux brings an end to all of this.
